###📊 Power BI E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

##🔍 Project Overview

This project is based on 5 years of E-commerce sales data and was created during my internship at Future Intern.
The objective of this project is to clean raw sales data, build an interactive Power BI dashboard, and generate meaningful sales and business insights to support decision-making.

#🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

*Power BI

*Power Query (ETL)

*Excel

*DAX

#🔄 Data Cleaning & ETL Process

The raw dataset contained multiple data quality issues, which were resolved using Power Query (ETL):

*Cleaned messy and inconsistent user name values

*Handled blank and missing cells

*Formatted date columns correctly

*Corrected data types for numerical calculations

*Calculated Total Amount of Sales after cleaning

After cleaning and transformation, the refined dataset was imported into Power BI for dashboard creation and analysis.

##📈 Key Metrics Calculated

*Total Sales Amount

*Average of Total Sales

*Total Quantity Sold

*Sum of Quantity Sold

##📊 Dashboard Visualizations

#The dashboard includes the following visual elements:

#Line Chart

*Sum of Quantity Sold & Total Sales Amount by Payment Method

#Waterfall Chart

*Total Sales Amount by Product Category

#Treemap

*Quantity Sold by Product Brand

#Pie Chart

*Product Count by Delivery Status

#Slicers

*Month

*Year

#These slicers allow users to dynamically filter and analyze data across different time periods.
